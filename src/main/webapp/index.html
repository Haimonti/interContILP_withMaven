    <h3>Hermes: Consensus Based Algorithms for Relational Streaming Data </h3>
     <p style="text-align: left;">	version 1.0 </p>
     
    <h4>
    Overview
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    Hermes implements consensus based algorithms for streaming relational data.
    It requires a Prolog compiler (<a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/yap/">YAP</a>) and uses <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/programinduction/Aleph/aleph.html">Aleph</a> as the ILP engine. The consensus algorithm is implemented in Java. The main features of the program(s) are the following: <br>
    (a) The server has a feature file and background knowledge with which it is able to construct a local model. It is capable of receiving client requests in the form of feature files, make an union with its own feature set and generate a new model. The new model is built using the multiplicative update procedure proposed by Littlestone and Warmuth. <br>
    (b) On completing an update procedure including construction of the new model, the weights learnt are sent back to the client who then updates its own local model. <br>
