    <h3>Hermes: Consensus Based Algorithms for Relational Streaming Data </h3>
     <p style="text-align: left;">	version 1.0 </p>
     
    <h4>
    Overview
    </h4>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    Hermes implements consensus based algorithms for streaming relational data.
    It requires a Prolog compiler (<a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/yap/">YAP</a>) and uses <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/programinduction/Aleph/aleph.html">Aleph</a> as the ILP engine. The consensus algorithm is implemented in Java. The main features of the program(s) are the following: <br>
    (a) The server has a feature file and background knowledge with which it is able to construct a local model. It is capable of receiving client requests in the form of feature files, make an union with its own feature set and generate a new model. The new model is built using the multiplicative update procedure proposed by Littlestone and Warmuth. <br>
    (b) On completing an update procedure including construction of the new model, the weights learnt are sent back to the client who then updates its own local model. <br>

     <h4>
    Test the system.
    </h4>
    <b> Step 1:  </b> 
    <br>Upload a feature file. Your file should be named feature_local.pl and should contain 'aleph_feature' tags <br>
    for e.g. '$aleph_feature'(1,[],A,pos(B),(has_car(B,C),has_car(B,D),short(C))) is a valid feature for the file. <br><br>
    <form method="post" action="QueryServlet" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Upload a file: <input type="file" name="uploadFile" />
    <br/><br/> 
     <input type="submit" value="Upload File" />
  </form>
